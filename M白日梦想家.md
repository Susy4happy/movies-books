The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.
To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, to draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the Purpose of LIFE. This movie is to describe the motto of this magazine. 被误解是表达者的宿命，事实是简单的一句话，每个人都有不同的理解。When Sean left a note for the gift he sent to Walter, Walter thought the wallet was the gift, but the truth was Sean put the real gift - negative No.25 inside the wallet. And Walter missed that, Walter was always on the way to look for Sean to ask about the negative No.25, which will be the last cover of the LIFE magazine.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80beafd0-27d3-4ffc-8ca8-bd315bb3a23e) Walter threw the wallet away when he got fired and his mom gave him some clues to find Sean. When Walter met Sean in the Himalayas, he knew where the negative No.25 was and he was vexed since he thought the thing was gone with the wallet. Luckily his mom collected that for Walter. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdb208d5-4a96-4009-b844-39e1487cac01) 片中的主角直到杂志出刊才知道封面是啥，观影时看到这个画面，我是很触动的。那种感觉就是有人看到并认可了你的工作。整个影片的配乐很轻快，故事的衔接转折很自然，意料之外的不突兀。很喜欢Sean在喜马拉雅山上拍摄雪豹时说的话，有时候就是有那样一瞬间想独享快乐，不想被相机打扰这个时刻。主角Walter在冰岛上的那段旅程好自由啊...
